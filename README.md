# UFOs

## Overview of Project

### Purpose of this Analysis

#### Although Dana's website and dynamic table are functioning as intended, she would like to offer a more thorough examination of UFO encounters by enabling viewers to simultaneously select for several parameters. That would be what this project would focus on, table filters for the city, state, country, and shape will be added in addition to the date.

## Results

### Accessing through index.html you can see the beginning of the web page with some data in the center and some filters on the left side of the page. To use these filters to obtain the desired rows from the database, you can simply fill each filter with information (complying with the structure of the example that exists in each box).

### For example, in the following image you can see how the "Enter State" filter is used to filter only the rows of the State of Florida.

### However, you can use more than one filter at the same time, for example, as can be seen in the following image, you can see the use of the City and State filters. You only have to follow the example provided in the box to complete each filter to be able to make correct use of these and the filtered database will automatically appear.

## Summary

### A drawback of this web page could be the way in which the information is arranged, as it may seem somewhat old in terms of technology. Well, nowadays we see web pages with very good design and it drives us to believe more in their reliability and updating.

### An important recommendation for the web page would be to consider the implementation of an API that obtains more up-to-date information and that through code this information is codified within the database and it can be obtained that it is up-to-date and easily accessible in One place. On the other hand, another recommendation would be to reconsider the filters and columns of the database so that it can be more globalized, since there are countries in which there are no States or they are called in another way and it can confuse users when they are trying to filter. or get information about UFOs.
